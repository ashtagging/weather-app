# Weather API React App

This application uses axios to make an API call to the open weather API in order to retrieve information regarding the weather of a specified location. The unsplashed API is aditionally used in order to generate a background image related to this location.

The main issue for myself when producing this project was trying to get the backend server to work so the API keys were not displayed on the front end. This was eventually achieved using express, dotenv, cors, axios and then searching on stack overflow when stuck.
